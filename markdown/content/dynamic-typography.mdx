Typography drives tone before any copy is read. A dynamic system adapts tracking, line length, and rhythm as the viewport or content density changes. Codify these rules once and you can layer any type family on top without re-tuning every screen.

## Metric Tables as Source of Truth

- Document each size token (label, body, title, display) with font size, line height, letter-spacing, and optical correction notes.
- Include both px and rem values along with `clamp()` ranges for fluid scaling.
- Store vertical rhythm multiples (baseline grid) beside the tables so spacing engineers can align components with type.

Example entry:

```
T3 Title
size: clamp(20px, 2vw, 24px)
line-height: 1.25
tracking: -0.012em desktop / 0em mobile
baseline: 4 px grid
```

## Responsive Letter-Spacing

- Tight fonts like Inter need extra breathing room below 16 px to prevent blur on low-density displays. Add +0.01–0.02 em tracking for small body text.
- High-contrast serif faces benefit from slight negative tracking at large sizes to avoid airy headings.
- Automate tracking adjustments by viewport width: define breakpoints where tracking shifts, or use a formula inside CSS custom properties.

## Line Length and Rhythm

- Aim for 60–72 characters per line on desktop, 40–50 on mobile.
- Use `ch` units or `max-width` constraints on prose containers so text never stretches to the viewport edge.
- Keep line height proportional to size: 1.4 for body, 1.2 for headings, 1.0–1.1 for dense UI labels.

## Advanced Corrections

- **Optical alignment**: align numerals using tabular figures when digits must line up (timestamps, metrics).
- **Baseline locking**: set `leading-trim` or manual offsets to remove built-in font padding and keep successive blocks evenly spaced.
- **Viewport-aware ligatures**: disable discretionary ligatures on small screens to avoid ambiguous shapes.

## Testing Ritual

1. Render the typography specimen page in light and dark themes; adjust contrast if one theme flattens hierarchy.
2. Screenshot on macOS, Windows, and Android; hinting differences often reveal tracking issues.
3. Print the specimen. Paper exposes line-height problems faster than screens.
4. Run automated QA: compare generated CSS tokens against the table to catch drift.

A well-documented type system becomes a living contract. Designers can introduce new expressive styles, engineers can ship them reliably, and every article referencing typography can link back to the same metrics instead of inventing another scale.
