People remember peaks, not wallpaper. When every interaction sparkles, none of them stand out. The rarity principle argues for rationing “wow” moments so they carry narrative weight and align with product goals.

## What Makes Delight Rare

- **Context**: Surprise works when expectations are stable. Establish calm baselines before introducing flourish.
- **Timing**: Trigger delight at meaningful moments—successful completion, personal milestones, recovery from an error.
- **Craft**: A single high-quality touch (custom sound, bespoke easing, micro-story) outperforms ten average ones.

## A Simple Framework

1. **Map the journey** and flag emotionally significant beats.
2. **Assign intention**: reassure, celebrate, reward, or reveal.
3. **Choose a medium** that reinforces the intention (motion, sound, copy, haptics).
4. **Set constraints**: duration &lt; 500 ms, no blocking of core tasks, accessible fallback.
5. **Log usage** so you can see if delight moments are overused or ignored.

## Examples of Selective Delight

- A receipt screen that animates the final total once, aligning with financial relief.
- A search empty state that reveals an easter egg illustration only after multiple failed attempts, acknowledging the user’s effort.
- A dark-mode transition that subtly shifts ambient sound, reinforcing mood change without hijacking the flow.

## When Not to Add Sparkle

- Critical workflows (checkout, incident response) demand clarity over showmanship.
- Accessibility contexts where additional motion or sound adds cognitive load.
- Early stages of a product with shaky fundamentals; fix performance and hierarchy first.

## Measuring Impact

- Track completion rates before/after introducing the moment. If they drop, remove the flourish.
- Monitor replay frequency. Delight that users trigger repeatedly (like confetti when nothing notable happened) quickly becomes noise.
- Conduct qualitative interviews. If users describe the detail without prompting, the rarity is working.

Selective delight signals editorial intent. It tells the user the team considered their emotional arc, not just their clicks. Anchor every future philosophy or craft note in this principle and you will avoid the trap of trend-chasing spectacle.
