Animations are not aesthetic garnish—they tell the system how to behave under stress. The choice between a classic easing curve and a spring simulation changes how heavy components feel, how quickly users regain control, and how believable the interface appears. Instead of defaulting to cubic-bezier presets or rubber-band springs, anchor the decision in intent.

## Start With Intention

| Goal | Preferred System | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Communicate certainty (confirmation, modal snap) | Easing | Predictable velocity gives the sense of confident completion. |
| Imply weight or elasticity | Spring | Acceleration and overshoot convey stored energy. |
| Match physical artifacts (cards, drawers, sliders) | Spring | Mirrors expectations set by touch interfaces and hardware. |
| Keep UI invisible (micro-feedback, focus shifts) | Easing | Clean acceleration avoids calling attention to itself. |
| Teach cause → effect | Either | Pick the system that best emphasizes the causal relationship; clarity beats fidelity. |

## Map Interaction Weight

Think in terms of energy. Light interactions (hover, ripples) should not bounce; the user expended almost no effort. Medium interactions (drag, re-ordering) can show a single, well-damped spring overshoot. Heavy gestures (dismiss stacks, physics toys) benefit from layered springs or chained easing plus spring finishes.

## Responsiveness and Control

- **Springs** shine when the user can interrupt the motion. They naturally accelerate toward rest and feel forgiving when the user re-engages.
- **Easings** excel for one-shot transitions. They finish exactly when you expect, making sequencing and choreography simple.
- Combine both by easing into a spring: ease-out to 90% of the journey, then hand off to a critically damped spring for the last stretch. This gives predictability up front and realism at the end.

## Decision Checklist

1. **What story are you telling?** If the element represents a surface or container, bias toward springs.
2. **How fast must control return?** If latency must stay under 150 ms, use eased curves with short durations.
3. **Is the user watching or acting?** Observed transitions can linger 0.25–0.35 s; interactive ones must settle &lt;0.2 s.
4. **Does motion stack?** If multiple properties animate, ensure each uses the same system to avoid desynchronization.
5. **Will reduced motion disable transforms?** Provide fallbacks for both systems; never rely on a spring bounce to convey state.

## Implementation Notes

- Prefab easing curves: `ease-out-quart` for confident exits, `ease-in-out-cubic` for in-place adjustments.
- Spring defaults: mass 1, stiffness 220, damping 28 for UI components; reduce damping to 18 for playful cards.
- Clamp overshoot to &lt;6 px on dense surfaces to prevent layout creep.
- Cache final transforms so rerenders do not break the spring mid-flight.

## QA Ritual

- Record side-by-side captures at 60 fps; scrub frame-by-frame to ensure the spring does not reverse more than once.
- Validate the pause menu: switch between easing-only and spring variants to confirm the difference is intentional.
- Sit with accessibility testers; ensure focus management ignores any delay introduced by motion.

Treat motion primitives like typography: reusable assets that express tone. Once the reasoning is explicit, every motion spec down the line can simply reference this decision tree.
