# Designing a Typographic System for the Web

The goal of this page is simple: look like a real article while secretly testing every typography style and MDX component in the system.

You can read it like a normal piece of writing, but behind the scenes it exercises headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, tables, code blocks, inline elements, and more.

## Why Typography Matters

Good typography does three things at once:

1. Makes content readable.
2. Gives the product a distinct voice.
3. Scales across use-cases without breaking.

Most users will never notice the specifics of line height, letter spacing, or rhythm. They only notice when something feels _off_. That is why we test type in realistic contexts instead of sterile samples.

### Hierarchy in Practice

A typographic scale is useless if every heading looks the same. In a real article, hierarchy is:

- A clear **H1** that anchors the page.
- Section-level **H2** headings that break the story into chapters.
- Supporting **H3** headings that group related ideas.
- Occasional **H4** headings used for fine-grained structure, labels, or side notes.

#### Fine Print and Microcopy

Smaller sizes matter just as much. Error messages, helper text, captions, and disclaimers all rely on consistent microcopy styles. If they are too small, too light, or misaligned, the interface feels unreliable.

## Structuring Content

Real content is rarely a single block of text. It mixes narrative, lists, quotes, and technical fragments.

### Lists in the Wild

Unordered lists work well for loose collections:

- Key principles
  - Consistency
  - Contrast
  - Rhythm
- UI details
  - Button labels
  - Form errors
  - Empty states
- Implementation notes

Ordered lists work better when sequence matters:

1. Define the type scale.
2. Map tokens to components.
3. Apply styles to the prose.
   1. Check headings in long pages.
   2. Check paragraphs at different widths.
      1. Validate mobile breakpoints.
      2. Validate desktop layouts.
         1. Test extreme cases.
         2. Log issues for follow-up.
3. Iterate based on real content.

## Quoting and Emphasis

> A good typographic system disappears.  
> What stays is the feeling that everything is in the right place.

Blockquotes are useful for calls-out, testimonials, or important definitions. They should feel related to the body, not like a different website.

Inside a paragraph, you still need inline emphasis: **bold** for weight, _italics_ for nuance, ~~strikethrough~~ for revisions, and `inline code` for technical fragments. [Links](#tables) should be visible but not screaming for attention.

## Code in Content

Design systems often document usage with short code samples. Those samples should be readable, scannable, and visually distinct from prose.

```tsx title="TypographyExample.tsx"
import React from "react";

export function TypographyExample() {
  return (
    <article className="prose">
      <h1>Designing with Type</h1>
      <p>
        Start with a clear scale, then apply it consistently across headings,
        body text, and UI copy.
      </p>
      <code>--font-size-body: 14px;</code>
    </article>
  );
}
