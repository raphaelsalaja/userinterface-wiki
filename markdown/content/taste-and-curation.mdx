Taste is not innate. It is cultivated through deliberate exposure, synthesis, and critique. Designers who describe their taste as a “vibe” usually rely on whatever the timeline is feeding them. Designers who treat taste as a skill build libraries, connect disciplines, and edit ruthlessly.

## Frameworks for Taste

- **Bourdieu’s cultural capital** reminds us that taste is shaped by context. Understanding the references your audience brings matters as much as your own preferences.
- **Music theory** shows how constraint breeds character. Genres recycle chord progressions but differentiate through texture and pacing. Apply the same logic to UI systems.
- **Architecture** teaches proportion and permanence. Study how brutalist facades balance mass and human scale, then translate that into component spacing.

## Build a Living Archive

1. Collect references across mediums: film frames, editorial spreads, typography specimens, furniture catalogs.
2. Tag entries by attributes (materiality, palette, mood) so you can pull combinations quickly.
3. Revisit and prune monthly. Stale references drag new work backward.

## Practice Seeing

- Run comparative studies: place two interfaces side by side and articulate why one feels more intentional.
- Sketch over screenshots. Annotate where hierarchy succeeds or fails.
- Conduct curation sprints where you only gather analog references for a week. It prevents the internet from homogenizing your inputs.

## Editing as a Superpower

Taste sharpens in the edit. Build rituals:

- Write a reduction brief: describe the experience in three sentences, then remove one. If the concept falls apart, the idea is not focused enough.
- After every exploration, delete half the artboards. Keep only the versions that make a clear argument.
- Ask, “Will this still make sense in five years?” If not, question whether the novelty is worth it.

## Applying Taste to Product Work

- Translate abstract inspiration into constraints (e.g., “Use a chromatic palette with one accent channel”).
- Explain the reference when handing designs to engineers. Taste is teachable if the rationale is explicit.
- Document why you rejected certain directions. Future contributors learn faster when they see what did not make the cut.

Taste is the lens through which you decide, not the decoration you add at the end. Train it like any other skill, and your work will age with the grace of its influences—not the speed of the trend cycle.
