The Family Crypto app is known for its smooth text transitions. I've wanted to create a similar effect for a while now on the web but never found the right approach as well time to implement it. This weekend after being pestered a lot by [Jace](https://x.com/JaceThings), I finally found the time to implement it, here's the result after some back and forth with Cursor + Claude.
