# A Living Manual for Better Interfaces

Knowledge should be shared. This wiki is a collection of articles, patterns, and best practices for designing and building user interfaces. It's a wiki that evolves with the field, incorporating new insights and techniques as they emerge, all for free.

## Tech Stack

The backbone of this wiki is built with [Fumadocs](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs), it's a wonderful framework for creating documentation sites using Next.js and MDX. 

Most if not all components are also built with [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/). This in my opinion is the best design system for building modern web applications with React.

The articles are transcribed using [Eleven Labs](https://elevenlabs.io/), a powerful text-to-speech service that produces natural-sounding voiceovers.

## Writing Articles

Articles live in `content/` as MDX files. Each article has its own folder with an `index.mdx` and optional `demos/` folder for interactive examples.

If you'd like to contribute an article, open a pull request with your content. I'm happy to review and merge contributions that align with the goals of this wiki.

Articles are transcribed using [Eleven Labs](https://elevenlabs.io/). Due to API limitations, if you wish to transcribe new or updated articles, please reach out to me directly. I'll be happy to assist you with the transcription process. 

## Feedback & Suggestions

If you have feedback, suggestions for new articles, or improvements to existing content/website, please open an issue.
